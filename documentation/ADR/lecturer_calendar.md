# Add a calendar with default consultations to the lecturer dashboard

## Status

Accepted.

## Context

We are developing a web application that requires robust calendar functionality. This includes display of dates, events, and the ability to add, edit, or remove events dynamically.

Instead of building this functionality from scratch, which would be time-consuming and potentially error-prone, we considered using an existing library that provides these features.

After evaluating several options, we decided to use FullCalendar due to its wide range of features, extensive documentation, and active support community.

## Decision

We will integrate the FullCalendar library into our web application to handle calendar-related functionality.

## Consequences

### Pros:

1. **Feature-rich**: FullCalendar is a mature and robust library that provides a wide range of features out of the box. This will greatly accelerate the development process and reduce the need for custom code.

2. **Widespread use and support**: FullCalendar is widely used and well-documented. This ensures that help and resources for troubleshooting and learning are readily available.

3. **Ease of integration**: FullCalendar can be easily integrated into our existing system, as it is compatible with various environments and can be installed via npm for use in Node.js.

### Cons:

1. **Additional dependency**: The introduction of FullCalendar as a dependency means we need to keep track of its updates, potential security issues, and handle any breaking changes in new versions.

2. **Potential complexity in customization**: While FullCalendar offers many features out of the box, customizing it or adding complex features may require a deeper understanding of the library, adding to development time and complexity.
