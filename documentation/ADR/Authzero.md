# Implementing AuthZero login in a Node and Express app
## Status
Accepted
## Context
We are building a Node.js and Express application that requires authentication and authorization for certain routes. We could build our own solution to handle user authentication and authorization, but this would take significant time and resources, and it may not be as secure or feature-rich as a third-party solution. After researching several options, we have decided to use Auth0 as our authentication and authorization service.
## Decision
We will integrate Auth0 with our Node.js and Express app to handle user authentication and authorization. This will involve the following steps:
- Create an Auth0 account and configure our application in the Auth0 dashboard.
- Install the Auth0 Node.js SDK and add the necessary middleware to our Express app to handle user authentication and authorization.
- Implement login and logout routes in our app that will redirect the user to the Auth0 login and logout pages respectively.
- Protect certain routes in our app by adding the Auth0 middleware to them.
## Consequences
### Pros
- We will have a secure and reliable solution for user authentication and authorization.
- Auth0 provides many useful features, such as social login, multi-factor authentication, and passwordless login, that we can easily integrate into our app.
- Auth0 handles many security concerns for us, such as user password hashing and encryption, and session management.
- Using a third-party solution like Auth0 saves us significant time and resources compared to building our own solution.
- Avoids security vulnerabilities that can result from custom implementation
- Provides out-of-the-box features such as multi-factor authentication, social login, and single sign-on
- Enables customization and scalability to fit your specific needs
- Offers 24/7 support and a robust ecosystem of integrations and plugins
- Saves time and effort in maintaining and updating authentication and authorization services
- Allows your team to focus on core business logic instead of authentication and authorization
- Protected domains for increased security
- Remembers user login
### Cons
- We will have to learn and integrate a new technology, which may take some time and effort.
- There will be some ongoing costs associated with using Auth0, such as subscription fees and possible transaction fees.
- There is a small risk of service interruption or outage if Auth0 experiences any issues or downtime.
