# Convert html to ejs

## Description
.ejs (Embedded JavaScript) is a template engine used for server-side rendering of dynamic web pages in Node.js applications. It allows developers to generate HTML pages with dynamic content by embedding JavaScript code directly into HTML markup. EJS templates can include variables, loops, conditionals, and functions, making it easier to generate dynamic content and maintain a clean separation of concerns between presentation and logic. EJS templates can be used to render dynamic web pages on the server-side and can also be used in client-side applications with frameworks such as Angular, React, and Vue. EJS is easy to learn and use, and it integrates seamlessly with Express, one of the most popular Node.js web frameworks.

## Why it was implimented
- Allows for dynamic content generation and reuse of code blocks
- Provides a clean separation of concerns between presentation and logic
- Supports conditional statements, loops, and functions to create dynamic content
- Integrates easily with Express, one of the most popular Node.js web frameworks
- Makes it easier to manage and maintain large-scale applications
- Enables developers to use familiar JavaScript syntax to write templates
- Reduces the amount of repetitive code needed to generate dynamic content
- Allows for easy sharing of templates between server-side and client-side applications
- Provides a higher degree of flexibility in terms of generating dynamic content compared to HTML
