# Implementing Winston Logging in a Node and Express app

## Status

Approved

## Context

We are building a Node.js and Express application that requires logging of various events, such as errors, warnings, and information messages. We could use the default console.log() function to log these events, but this has several limitations and drawbacks, such as:

- Limited log levels (e.g. no support for custom log levels)
- Limited log output formatting options
- Limited log storage options (e.g. no support for remote logging)
- Limited log transport options (e.g. no support for logging to multiple destinations)

After researching several options, we have decided to use Winston as our logging library for this application.

## Decision

We will integrate Winston with our Node.js and Express app to handle logging of various events. This will involve the following steps:

- Install Winston and any necessary plugins (such as Winston transports for remote logging)
- Configure Winston with our desired log levels, output formatting, storage, and transport options
- Replace all instances of console.log() in our codebase with Winston log statements, using the appropriate log level and message

## Consequences

### Pros

- We will have a more flexible and extensible logging solution that can handle a wider range of log events and output formats
- Winston provides many useful features, such as custom log levels, log rotation, remote logging, and logging to multiple destinations
- Winston is widely used and well-supported, with a large community and many plugins available
- Using Winston improves code consistency and readability by providing a standardized logging interface
- Better workflow integration

### Cons

- We will have to learn and integrate a new technology, which may take some time and effort.
- There may be some additional overhead and complexity associated with configuring and maintaining Winston, compared to using console.log()
- There may be some performance impact associated with using a more feature-rich logging library, although this is usually negligible.


## Why it was implimented
- Improves on the default console.log
- Removes bottle necks from over logging
