|Implemented good functionality|Slight confusion about what the brief require lead to long discussions|Clarified with the lecturer at the start of the project|
 
Retrospective meeting was held on Friday 2 June at 10 AM and lasted for 1 hour:
Again, Bryce shared a google doc for the sprint retrospective meeting so that all group members could add details about their tickets as this worked rather well.

The entire team collaborated and created the table discussing what went well, what went wrong and what the team could have done better. 

We debriefed and although it was stressful we all agreed this project was a valuable learning experience. Ruth-Ann pointed out, and the team agreed, that the project would have been better if we had been given a few weeks to plan before starting the project. 

Sprint Velocity for Sprint 4: The number of story points completed was 14. For the final sprint, the stories were focussed on ensuring that the project was finished. Time management was important, and it was encouraging that 7 user stories were completed per week and that the more than 7 stories were not left for the last week.
