# Sprint Retrospective for Week 2


| What the team did well | What went wrong | What the team could have done better |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Completed all user stories within the sprint | Database was hard to merge | Could have used controllers and services for the database |


| Worked at preventing large merge conflicts | Had to wait for the database to be set up | Could have completed the database early on in the week |


| Most of the team met in person to work on the code | Integration testing worked only on the local server | Look at disabling remote testing, using screenshots to show the results|


| Implemented a database while adding new user stories | Pipeline for the student bookings was not set up correctly |Additional testing of the database|


| |Lack of proper testing | Write lots of small and fast unit tests. Some coarse-grained tests and very few high-level tests that test our application from end to end|


||Unaligned interpretations| Discuss UI, Acceptance criteria, and what is required for the minimum viable product|


Retrospective meeting was held on Monday 22 May at 9 PM and lasted for 1 hour:
Bryce shared a google doc for the sprint retrospective meeting so that all group members could add details about their tickets.
Ruth-Ann updated the group about a good procedure if the local tests run and the remote tests do not
The entire team collaborated and created the table discussing what went well, what went wrong and what the team could have done better.


Sprint Velocity for Sprint 2: The number of story points completed was 18. This is 2 more than sprint 1. In light of the number of other submissions for other projects, this was reasonable. For sprint 3, it was decided that a greater number of story points should be completed.
