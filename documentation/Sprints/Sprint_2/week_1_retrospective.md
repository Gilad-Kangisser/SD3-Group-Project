# Sprint Retrospective for Week 1

| What the team did well | What went wrong | What the team could have done better |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Completed all user stories within the sprint | Several merge conflicts delayed the completion of some tasks | Could have done a better job of communicating updates during daily standups |
| Consistently met daily standup times | Two stories were one in the same and needed to be combined| Make sure each story is unique|
| Effective use of project management tools | Scope of one user story was underestimated, causing delays | Need to improve user story estimation process |
| Worked well as a team | Some of the stories were too big, had to be split | Need to get better at creating good stories |
| Helped eachother Fix Merge Conflicts | Loadshedding, not knowing how to tag a pull, led to the sprint being realsed at 12pm exactly | Need to plan to finish early next time |

The sprint velocity for this week was 7 out of 7 (Two sprints were combined)

Retrospective meeting were held on Thursay at 9 PM and lasted for 2 hours
