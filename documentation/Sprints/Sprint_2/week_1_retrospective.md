# Sprint Retrospective for Week 1

| What the team did well | What went wrong | What the team could have done better |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Completed all user stories within the sprint | Several merge conflicts delayed the completion of some tasks | Could have done a better job of communicating updates during daily standups |
| Consistently met daily standup times | Two stories were one in the same and needed to be combined| Make sure each story is unique|
| Effective use of project management tools | Scope of one user story was underestimated, causing delays | Need to improve user story estimation process |
| Worked well as a team | Some of the stories were too big, had to be split | Need to get better at creating good stories |
| Helped eachother Fix Merge Conflicts | Loadshedding, not knowing how to tag a pull, led to the sprint being realsed at 12pm exactly | Need to plan to finish early next time |

Using the story point matrix from: https://asana.com/resources/story-points

The expected sprint velocity was obtained by tabulating the number of sprint points. It was 16. Having a sprint velocity of 16 is probably good for next week as well. Perhaps a bit higher. 
We started the week without allocating sprint points, as we failed to remember to do that. However, they were added subsequently when reflecting back on the week.
Some of the stories took longer than what they should have, based on their complexity and risk. Their stories points were not increased to reflect this, as story points are more than just a 
indication of the time taken to complete the task. The reason for the slowness was because the team was getting used to the project, and creating web apps. 
It is expected that subsequent stories will be completed quicker.

Retrospective meeting were held on Thursay at 9 PM and lasted for 2 hours. Further discussions were completed on Monday 15 May, after the lecture period and further discussion with the lecturer.
