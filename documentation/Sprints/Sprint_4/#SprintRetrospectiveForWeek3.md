# Sprint Retrospective for Week 3


| What the team did well | What went wrong | What the team could have done better |
| --- | --- | --- |
|We were able to refactor project into services and controllers with minimal errors |This resulted in a wastage of time |Should have used services and controllers from the very beginning|


|We were able to implement  frontend and backend unit tests, playwright tests, and tests for the database|Lots of trial and error before a working solution was found|The team could have done additional research and possibly organize a consultation with our lecturer for further assistance|
|Further unit testing was implemented|Some tests ran locally but not remotely | Should have found out how to test if they could run remotely before merging branches|
|User stories were generally independent|||


Retrospective meeting was held on Tuesday 22 May at 4 PM and lasted for 1 hour:
Again, Bryce shared a google doc for the sprint retrospective meeting so that all group members could add details about their tickets as this worked rather well.
Daron and Gilad updated the group on how to further implement playwright test. 
Bryce explained how to test functions in the frontend as well as how to use winston logging for logging on the backend and logging of the frontend through api calls 
Ruth-Ann updated the group about proper coding procedures and how to implement tests on API calls and services. Both which utilize a mock database. 
Rotenda discussed how he updated each story and pull requests to ensure uniform documentation. 
Daron discussed cleaning the database and creating a test student and lecturer
The entire team collaborated and created the table discussing what went well, what went wrong and what the team could have done better.
